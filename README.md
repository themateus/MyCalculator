I build a Console Calculator App with the help of Microsoftâ€™s Documentation.

Challenges I have implemented from The C# Academy:
- Create a functionality that will count the amount of times the calculator was used.
- Store a list with the latest calculations. And give the users the ability to delete that list.
- Allow the users to use the results in the list above to perform new calculations.
